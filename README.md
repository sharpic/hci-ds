## Abstract
This talk will try to set out where Human Computer Interaction sits in a world rapidly moving to Data Science. Data Science, is seen as a home for statisticians, machine learners, data warehousers, and the like; but it seems to have nowhere for the human component. I suggest HCI is much more useful than many computer scientists creating tools and analytics would think. How we understand big and broad data can be augmented by rich HCI techniques, how we understand scientist users, how we communicate complex data outcomes to the public (allowing them some form of involvement) are all directly within the HCI domain. To have impact data needs a narrative, HCI can give it one.   

Presentation given to Fabio Patern√≤'s group at the [Human Interfaces in Information Systems (HIIS) Laboratory](http://hiis.isti.cnr.it/) CNR. Thursday 21st May 2015. The presentation has evolved from that given to the BBC at the UMRI Kick-off Workshop but significantly extended and changed.
